### 2. Possession vs. Goals (The Efficiency Myth)
Does high possession guarantee goals? **Not necessarily.**
* **The Dominators:** Shakhtar (64.8%) & Dynamo (57.9%) convert possession into goals effectively.
* **The Efficiency Kings:** **Kryvbas** scores 28 goals with only **48.2% possession**. Their vertical style yields a high ROI (0.58 goals per 1% possession).
* **Sterile Possession:** Karpaty controls the ball (54.7%) but fails to score (only 17 goals), indicating a lack of penetration.

### 3. Metalist 1925 Squad Depth
The team relies heavily on two players (Itodo & Antiukh). The gap between them and the rest of the squad is a tactical risk.
